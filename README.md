# 2WD_4WD_Switch

## Switch Design Goals

* Have 2 12V rated transistors on the 2WD/4WD engagement switch
* One turns on when the switch is pressed to the 4WD engagement state
* One turns on when the switch is pressed to the 4WD disengagement state
* Read both of these on the dashboard Arduino side and light up dashboard accordingly
  
* (MAYBE) capacitor on switch to make it so you just need to tap switch instead of holding
